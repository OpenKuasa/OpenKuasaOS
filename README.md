# OpenKuasa OS

**The open-source business OS for Malaysian SMEs — one self-hostable app
instead of a stack of separate CRM, HR, payroll and accounting subscriptions.**
Ads, CRM, HR, recruitment and accounting in one place, with an AI command center
on top — built in the open on Next.js, React and Supabase.

OpenKuasa is crowd-sourced: it is developed in the open by its maintainers and
volunteer contributors.

**Free to self-host, always.** A paid hosted version is planned for people who
would rather not run it themselves. It is built on the code in this repository,
which stays open source under AGPL-3.0.

## What's inside

Six modules and a cross-app assistant, named after the Malay warriors and court
of Melaka. **83 module screens** are built so far.

| Module | What it does | Alternative to | Route | Screens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tuah** | AI command center — chat with your whole business | AI business copilots | `/command` | chat |
| **Jebat** | Ads — ad studio, creative bank, lead forms, reports | ad platforms & agencies | `/reach` | 10 |
| **Kasturi** | CRM — contacts, deals kanban, broadcast, chatbot, automations | CRM tools | `/crm` | 11 |
| **Lekiu** | Team — employees, attendance, leave, claims, payroll, performance | HR & payroll suites | `/people` | 27 |
| **Lekir** | Recruit — jobs, candidates, applications, interviews, talent pool | recruiting (ATS) | `/hire` | 9 |
| **Bendahara** | Finance — invoicing, expenses, banking, e-Invoice, SST, ledgers | accounting software | `/finance` | 26 |
| **Taming Sari** | "Sari", the assistant available from every screen | — | everywhere | — |

The full menu for each module lives in `src/config/nav.ts`. The screens are in
`src/screens/` and are listed in `src/screens/registry.ts`; each one is served by
its own route file under `src/app/(app)/`, written by `pnpm gen:routes` (see
[Adding a screen](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-screen)).

  conversation view.

## Status

OpenKuasa OS is in early development. Being upfront about where it stands:

- **Built** — the complete product surface listed above: every screen,
  navigation, layout and interaction, running on sample data.
- **Not wired up yet** — a live backend. Screens do not read from or write to a
  database, the AI assistants and agents do not call a model, and integrations
  such as ad platforms, WhatsApp, payroll filings and LHDN MyInvois submission
  are not connected. Supabase is scaffolded for auth and data but nothing
  depends on it yet.

It is not ready to run a real business on. Contributions towards the backend
are very welcome.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) + **React 19**
- **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn/ui** (Radix primitives, `radix-nova` preset)
- **Supabase** (`@supabase/ssr`) for data, auth, and tenancy

## Getting Started

Requires Node 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenKuasa/OpenKuasaOS.git
cd OpenKuasaOS
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Supabase project's
values (Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

Until these are set, the app runs normally but the Supabase session refresh is a
no-op — see `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`.

## Self-hosting setup

Beyond the environment variables above (see `.env.example` for the full list:
the Supabase URL and anon/publishable key; the OpenRouter key is for a later
slice), a fresh Supabase project needs these Auth settings (Supabase dashboard →
Authentication) for sign-in and signup to work:

- **Enable Anonymous sign-ins** — powers the demo workspace and the tests.
- **Turn OFF "Confirm email"** — signup then creates a session immediately and
  lands on `/command`. With it on, signup stops at a "check your email" message
  and the user must confirm and sign in.
- **Leave hCaptcha OFF for now** — the auth forms don't yet pass a captcha
  token, so *enabling* hCaptcha would break sign-in and signup. Wiring the
  hCaptcha widget into the auth UI is a planned hardening step before it can be
  turned on in production.

## Supabase helpers

- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client (Client Components)
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions)
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` + `src/proxy.ts` — session refresh

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev      # start the dev server
pnpm build    # production build
pnpm start    # run the production build
pnpm lint     # eslint
```
