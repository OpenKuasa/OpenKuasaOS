/**
 * Lekiu's lookup tools. Each reads through the {@link PeopleData} seam and
 * calls the same pure helpers the screens call, so a number in the chat is the
 * number on the screen. `org_id` is never taken from the model, and nothing
 * here decides who may see a row: the provider returns what the caller's
 * session is allowed to read, and each personal lookup says which that is in
 * `scope`. An owner or admin also gets the change tools at the bottom, which call
 * the same functions the Employees screen does and each wait for approval.
